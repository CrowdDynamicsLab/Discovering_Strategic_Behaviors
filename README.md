Code for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03670">Discovering Strategic Behaviors for Collaborative Content-Production in Social Networks</a> (WWW 2020).

In this paper, we are motivated to investigate if resource-limited individuals discover strategic behaviors associated with high payoffs when producing collaborative/interactive content in social networks. We propose a novel framework of Dynamic Dual Attention Networks (DDAN) which models individuals' content production strategies through a generative process, under the influence of social interactions involved in the process. Extensive experimental results illustrate the model's effectiveness in user behavior modeling. We make three strong empirical findings: (1) Different strategies give rise to different social payoffs; (2) The best performing individuals exhibit stability in their preference over the discovered strategies, which indicates the emergence of strategic behavior; and (3) The stability of a user's preference is correlated with high payoffs.
